# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes Phase 3 of the Canvas integration for gedichtgevel.nl, enabling users to seamlessly navigate from search results to the canvas with their selected poem. The canvas component is already technically functional (Phase 1 & 2 complete), but the "ðŸŽ¨ Open in canvas" buttons are not yet connected to properly load poem data into the canvas. This phase focuses on creating a smooth user workflow from poem discovery to canvas visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing search results, I want to click "ðŸŽ¨ Open in canvas" on any poem, so that I can immediately start visualizing that specific poem in the canvas editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "ðŸŽ¨ Open in canvas" button on a search result THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/designgevel/{poemId}` with the selected poem data
2. WHEN navigating to canvas from search results THEN the system SHALL preserve all poem metadata (title, author, lines, etc.)
3. WHEN the canvas loads with poem data THEN the system SHALL display the poem text immediately without showing "poem data loading" indefinitely
4. IF the poem data is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display the demo poem from `src/data/canvas/testdata.js` as fallback content
5. WHEN accessing `/designgevel` without a poemId THEN the system SHALL load the demo poem to showcase canvas functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user in the canvas editor, I want the poem text to render correctly with proper formatting, so that I can see and manipulate the actual poem content I selected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN poem data is loaded in canvas THEN the system SHALL render each line of the poem as separate text elements
2. WHEN poem text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use proper typography (font family, size, spacing) as configured in canvas settings
3. WHEN poem lines are rendered THEN the system SHALL position them correctly within the canvas viewport
4. WHEN poem text is too long for viewport THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling or text scaling options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working in the canvas, I want to navigate back to search results easily, so that I can select different poems or continue browsing without losing my place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the back button in canvas THEN the system SHALL return to the previous search results page
2. WHEN navigating back from canvas THEN the system SHALL clear temporary canvas data from storage
3. WHEN returning to search THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's previous search query and results
4. IF the user navigates directly to a `/designgevel/{poemId}` URL THEN the system SHALL provide a clear path back to the main application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling for the canvas integration, so that users receive helpful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN poem data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with retry options
2. WHEN canvas initialization fails THEN the system SHALL show an error boundary with navigation back to search
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide offline fallback content or clear error messaging
4. WHEN invalid poem data is encountered THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a fallback poem

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the canvas integration to work smoothly, so that I can use the poem visualization feature on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing canvas on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for touch interaction
2. WHEN poem data loads on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure text is readable and properly sized
3. WHEN navigating between search and canvas on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles
4. WHEN using touch gestures in canvas THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to mobile interaction patterns
