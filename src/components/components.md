## Component Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should do one thing well
2. **Composability**: Components should be designed to work together
3. **Reusability**: Components should be reusable across the application
4. **Consistency**: Components should maintain consistent styling and behavior
5. **Testability**: Components should be easy to test in isolation

## Code Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Document components with JSDoc comments
- Include PropTypes for all components
- Keep components focused and small
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks
