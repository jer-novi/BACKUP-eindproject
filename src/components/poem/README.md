# PoemResultItem Refactoring

## Overview

The PoemResultItem component has been refactored from a single 451-line component into a modular architecture with clear
separation of concerns.

## New Structure

### Components (src/components/search/poem/)

- **PoemCard.jsx** (50 lines) - Main wrapper with motion animations
- **PoemHeader.jsx** (40 lines) - Title and author display
- **PoemExpansionControls.jsx** (60 lines) - Ellipsis and expand button
- **ExpandedContent.jsx** (65 lines) - Expanded poem content with animations
- **CanvasToast.jsx** (35 lines) - Canvas mode hint toast

### Custom Hooks (src/hooks/poem/)

- **useHeightCalculation.js** - Manages all height calculation logic
- **useCanvasMode.js** - Canvas mode specific functionality

### Utilities (src/utils/poem/)

- **textFormatting.js** - Text formatting and validation helpers

## Benefits

### Improved Maintainability

- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to test individual pieces
- Clear separation between UI and business logic

### Better Performance

- Smaller components mean more efficient re-renders
- Memoization is more effective with smaller components
- Custom hooks isolate complex calculations

### Enhanced Reusability

- Sub-components can be used elsewhere
- Hooks can be shared across different components
- Utilities are pure functions that can be tested independently

## Migration Guide

To use the new refactored component:

```jsx
// Old import
import PoemResultItem from './PoemResultItem';

// New import
import PoemResultItem from './PoemResultItemNew';
```

The API remains exactly the same - no changes needed in parent components.

## Component Sizes

Before refactoring:

- PoemResultItem.jsx: 451 lines

After refactoring:

- PoemResultItemNew.jsx: ~180 lines
- Sub-components: ~250 lines total
- Custom hooks: ~150 lines total
- Utilities: ~80 lines total

Each individual file is now under 200 lines, making them much more manageable.
