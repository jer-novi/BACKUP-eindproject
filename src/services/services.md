    - Single-responsibility methods

- **/api/poemSearchService.js**: Advanced search functionality
    - Intelligent search term analysis
    - Multi-field search and filtering
    - Search optimization and combination strategies

### Authentication

- **/auth/authService.js**: Authentication service methods
    - Login, register, logout functionality
    - Token management

### Storage

- **/storage/audioStorageService.js**: Service for audio storage
    - Saving recorded audio to Supabase
    - Retrieving user recordings

### Caching

- **cacheService.js**: Client-side caching service
    - In-memory cache for API responses
    - Cache invalidation and expiry

## Design Principles

1. **Abstraction**: Services abstract complex operations into simple interfaces
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a specific focus
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate data access from business logic
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and reporting
5. **Reusability**: Services are designed to be reused throughout the application

## Architecture Benefits

- **Testability**: Services can be easily mocked for testing
- **Maintainability**: Changes to external APIs are isolated to service modules
- **Consistency**: Consistent patterns for accessing external resources
- **Extensibility**: Adding new data sources or APIs is simplified
- **Performance**: Centralized location for optimizations like caching
